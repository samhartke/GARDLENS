# GARD-LENS

The Generalized Analog Regression Downscaling method Large Ensemble (GARD-LENS) dataset is comprised of daily precipitation, mean temperature, and temperature range over the Contiguous U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii at 12-km, 4-km, and 1-km resolutions, respectively. GARD-LENS downscales three CMIP6 global climate model large ensembles, CESM2, CanESM5, and EC-Earth3, totaling 200 ensemble members.
